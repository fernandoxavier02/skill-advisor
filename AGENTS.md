# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Skill Advisor is a **Codex plugin** that acts as an intelligent routing layer across the user's entire toolchain. It scans all installed skills, plugins, MCP servers, and agents, then recommends the optimal combination for any task — with execution order, dependencies, and dry-run preview.

Key constraints: hook must complete in <50ms, zero network calls, all processing runs locally.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (Node.js built-in test runner)
npm test

# Rebuild keyword + semantic index from all installed skills/plugins/MCPs
npm run index
# or: node lib/build-index.js

# Build semantic embeddings (requires @huggingface/transformers, ~2-5min first run)
node lib/build-embeddings.js

# Build Obsidian vault graph from vault-* directories
node lib/build-graph.js

# Scan sources for catalog generation
node lib/build-catalog.js
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow

There are two execution paths:

**Hook path (real-time, <50ms):**
```
User prompt → hooks/advisor-nudge.cjs
  → reads lib/advisor-index-lite.json (<100KB)
  → tokenize + PT-BR synonym expansion
  → semantic search (pre-computed embeddings) || keyword fallback
  → stdout nudge if score > threshold
```

**Command path (/advisor):**
```
/advisor <task> → commands/advisor.md
  → reads lib/advisor-index-full.json
  → gathers git/project context
  → spawns agents/advisor-router.md (Sonnet subagent)
  → router classifies task, matches index, builds loadout JSON
  → presents dry-run → user approves/modifies/cancels
```

### Search Pipeline (3 layers, tried in order)

1. **Semantic search** (`lib/semantic.js`) — cosine similarity of bag-of-words query embedding against pre-computed 384-dim vectors from `advisor-embeddings.json` + `advisor-vocab.json`. Model: `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

2. **Graph search** (`lib/graph-search.js`) — BFS traversal (max 2 hops) from alias-matched seed nodes in the Obsidian vault graph (`vault-graph/adjacency.json`). Scoring: `SCORE_BY_HOP = [1.0, 0.7, 0.4]`, with convergence boost (+0.15/extra seed) and category boost (+0.2 if task type matches).

3. **Keyword matching** (`hooks/advisor-nudge.cjs`) — tokenize prompt, expand PT-BR→EN via SYNONYMS map (50+ terms), score against skill names (3x weight) and descriptions (2x weight).

### Two-Tier Index

`lib/build-index.js` generates both indexes by scanning `~/.Codex/plugins/cache/`, `~/.Codex/skills/`, project `.Codex/skills/`, and MCP manifests:

- **Lite** (`advisor-index-lite.json`, <100KB): id, name, truncated description, invocation, category. Used by the hook for fast cold-reads.
- **Full** (`advisor-index-full.json`): all fields including type, source. Used by the /advisor command via the router subagent.

### Obsidian Vault

Four vault directories feed into the graph:
- `vault-skills/` — one .md card per skill with YAML frontmatter + `[[wikilinks]]`
- `vault-concepts/` — theme nodes (debugging, security, testing...)
- `vault-pipelines/` — pre-built step sequences (bugfix, feature, deploy...)
- `vault-graph/` — generated output: `adjacency.json` + `stats.json`

`lib/build-graph.js` parses vault files, resolves `[[wikilinks]]` into edges, builds bidirectional concept-concept edges, and writes the adjacency graph.

### Key Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `lib/paths.js` | All path resolution (index, config, telemetry, vault dirs) |
| `lib/build-index.js` | Scans sources, generates lite/full indexes. Exports `parseFrontmatter`, `inferCategory`, `dedup`, `scanSkills` |
| `lib/build-embeddings.js` | One-time embedding generation via `@huggingface/transformers` |
| `lib/semantic.js` | Runtime semantic search using pre-computed embeddings (no model loading) |
| `lib/build-graph.js` | Vault parser + graph builder. Exports `buildGraph`, `parseFrontmatter`, `extractWikilinks` |
| `lib/graph-search.js` | BFS traversal + alias matching + task-type inference. Exports `graphSearch`, `loadGraph`, `matchAliases`, `bfsTraverse` |
| `lib/build-catalog.js` | Scans plugin/skill sources for Obsidian vault card generation |
| `hooks/advisor-nudge.cjs` | UserPromptSubmit hook — ephemeral process, no in-memory cache |

### Plugin Structure

- `plugin.json` — manifest with `autoDiscover: true` (Codex auto-detects commands, agents, hooks, skills)
- `hooks/hooks.json` — registers `advisor-nudge.cjs` on `UserPromptSubmit`
- `commands/*.md` — 5 slash commands (advisor, advisor-catalog, advisor-config, advisor-feedback, advisor-index)
- `agents/advisor-router.md` — Sonnet subagent for task classification + loadout building
- `skills/advisor-skill/SKILL.md` — auto-trigger skill for tool guidance

## Conventions

- **CommonJS** (`require`/`module.exports`), not ESM. Exception: `build-embeddings.js` uses dynamic `import()` for `@huggingface/transformers`.
- **No external dependencies** except `@huggingface/transformers` (only for embedding generation, not at runtime).
- **Node.js >= 18** required (uses `node:test`, `node:assert/strict`).
- Tests use Node.js built-in test runner (`node --test`), not Jest/Mocha.
- Test fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/` with sample skills, plugins, and malformed data.
- `parseFrontmatter` exists in both `build-index.js` and `build-graph.js` with slightly different implementations (graph version handles YAML lists and inline arrays).
- The hook (`advisor-nudge.cjs`) must remain a single ephemeral CJS file — no persistent state, no async, no model loading.
- Bilingual PT-BR/EN support is a core requirement — synonym bridge, stopwords, and accent normalization must cover both languages.
